# JigsawWare
## A ProtestWare Ransomware project (in development)
This is **not intended by the maker to be used**, and is purely a statement publicly detesting the violence that Palestinian people are facing at the hands of<br>
Israel. I cannot be held liable for any damage done if a threat actor chooses to use my software for destructive purposes as I have no acknowledgement of any such 
conspiring **nor am I conspiring to use it against people myself.** I am however publicly posting this as open-source for educational purposes to educate corporations
the possible consequences that they may face if a TA decides to use something like this in the name of protest / denouncing the violence that we are seeing in the world
funded by stolen and undeserved money. Money that belongs in the hand of the people, not the oppressors.

For too long occupiers and colonizers have taken lands from indigenous people. By making this project, I am venting my frustration, must like an artist vents theirs in their art <br>
except, instead of physical or digital art, this is my technological masterpiece. 16 hours of development and counting so far, of time, anger, and passion I have devoted to
this project.

**Heed my warning: 
I may not be using this software against you, but someone else may use a similar software in the future that I cannot forsee.**

## Oh yes, there will be blood.

This software is still in development and my plans are to add keylogging functionality, info-stealing capabilities, and a C&C shell to this.
I also have already created a dropper in C++, when I am done programming this all, I plan to use Iron Python to compile this into a C++ program and then
use cython or IronPython to make a DLL for process hijacking using asyncio and other methods that will be injected upon opening the dropper trojan.

My code is very rudimentary at the moment. This has not been tested yet but there is no error in the code. 
I will link the video of the testing when I get around to testing it.
